/** Function taking a text szText and its lenght len, searching for a sequence of characters szSrc
 * and replaces with szRepl only and only if szSrc is a "word" after the following rules:
 *  - the character before and after the match of szSrc in szText returns 0 to isCharInsideWord(), 
 *  - one of these ends match the aforementioned condition and the other end is begin(szText) or beforeend(szText)
 * It doesn't matter what sequence of characters is the match of szSrc in szText, the aforementioned conditions
 * must be fulfiled: eg: for szText like "the $4%CK? brown fox" and szSrc being "$4%CK?" is a match because
 * the character before and after the sequence "$4%CK?" are just blanks
 * This function is useful only for replacing macro-like constants in a text-code. If you don't understand the
 * utility of this function you don't need it.
